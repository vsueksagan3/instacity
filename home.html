<h2>About this project</h2>
<p class="intro">My goal is to incorporate the already booming network of Instagram with geotags to map
out and develop an infrastructure in which a trending theme of each region can be identified.
Instagram is one of the most popular social networking services that allows its users to
take pictures and videos and share them with the public world. We create a website that can
retrieve photos from Instagram and present to our users.We choose six of the most popular cities in the world as the entries of our website and users can also be able to use our tagÂ­search function to get photos of their interests.</p>
